# heyron Blog - Post Writing Guidelines

This guide helps AI (and future you) write posts that sound authentically like Ron—a mind dump of real thoughts, not corporate polish.

## Core Principles

### Tone & Voice
- **Conversational & Raw** - Write like you're explaining something to a peer over coffee, not presenting to executives
- **Authentic > Consistent** - Your personality should shine through; embrace quirks and tangents
- **No Corporate Speak** - Avoid: "let's explore," "deep dive," "synergy," "game-changer," "leverage." These scream AI-generated.
- **Real Examples > Theory** - Ground posts in actual work (Nordstrom projects, observability wins, cost cuts) rather than abstract concepts

### Structure
- **Short Paragraphs** - Max 2-3 sentences. White space is your friend.
- **Lead with Why** - Hook readers with the problem or outcome first (e.g., "Cut credit decision time 52%," not "Let me tell you about optimization")
- **Use Headers** - Break content into scannable sections
- **Bullet Lists** - Great for lessons learned, gotchas, or multi-part ideas

### Style Details
- **Emojis** - Use sparingly but genuinely (🤖 for AI, ⛰️ for mountains, 🚀 for shipping, ✅ for wins). Only add if it feels natural.
- **Humor** - Self-deprecating jokes and PNW references are fair game; avoid forced memes
- **Technical Depth** - Assume readers are mid-level engineers; explain *why* something matters, not just *how*

### Good Post Example
**Title:** "52% Faster Credit Decisions: How We Optimized the Bottleneck"

*Lead:* "We cut credit adjudication time from 170s to 81s. Here's what actually worked (and what didn't)." ← Problem + outcome upfront

*Body:* Real changes (caching strategy, service split, monitoring), with specific wins and costs.

*Close:* Lessons for readers, not a sales pitch.

### Bad Post Example (Avoid)
**Title:** "Exploring Cloud Optimization Strategies"

*Lead:* "Let's dive deep into how companies can leverage cloud technologies..." ← Corporate jargon, no hook

*Body:* Generic advice, no real examples, theoretical frameworks.

*Close:* Vague call to action.

## Topics You Care About
- **.NET & AWS** - Your primary stack; posts should reflect real patterns you use
- **Reliability & Observability** - What you've built at Nordstrom (e.g., auto-recovery, SLA wins)
- **Cost Optimization** - Cloud economics, infrastructure decisions
- **AI Tools & Adoption** - Your current enthusiasm (Claude, AI agents, MCP servers, prompt engineering)
- **Shipping Fast** - CI/CD, tooling, team productivity
- **Lessons from Regulated Domains** - PCI/HIPAA insights without oversharing secrets

## Don't Overthink It
If it reads like you and has a real takeaway, it's good. Ship it.
