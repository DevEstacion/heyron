Hey! I'm Ron, a software engineer and AI enthusiast. I like solving problems and shipping code that works. 🚀

## What I'm Into

Exploring new tools and technologies, experimenting with AI like Claude and AI agents, and learning how to build systems better.

## Outside of Work

Based in Washington State. When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with family and friends.

## This Space
