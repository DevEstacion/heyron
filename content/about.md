# About Ron

Hey! I'm Ron, a Senior Software Engineer at **Nordstrom** where I optimize systems in regulated domains (PCI DSS, HIPAA). When things are broken or slow, I like to fix them—preferably in a way that saves money and ships faster. 🚀

## What I Do

- **Backend Systems** - .NET, AWS, Kubernetes, Kafka. Built services that handle millions in transactions and high-traffic seasonality
- **Cost & Reliability** - Cut credit decision latency 52%, saved ~$130k on compliance gaps, automated incident recovery to save engineering time
- **AI Enablement** - Adopted Claude Code, AI agents, and MCP servers across teams; member of Nordstrom's AI Special Interest Group

## Outside of Work

I'm based in Lacey, Washington (PNW 🌲). When I'm not shipping code, you'll find me hiking, mountaineering, or planning the next summit.

## This Space

heyron is a mind dump of thoughts on cloud economics, shipping velocity, observability, and how to build systems that don't keep you up at night. All thoughts are mine.
