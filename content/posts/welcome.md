## A New Space for Thoughts 🤖

Welcome to heyron! This is where I dump thoughts on the stuff I care about: optimizing systems, enabling revenue (literally—cut decision latency 52% at work), and shipping fast without breaking things.

I spend my days at **Nordstrom** building backend services in regulated domains (.NET, AWS, K8s). I see patterns in what works and what burns engineers out. I've also become genuinely excited about **AI tools**—not hype, but real productivity wins with Claude and AI agents.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Cost & Reliability** - How to do more with less cloud spend and fewer incidents
- **.NET & AWS** - Real patterns from high-traffic, mission-critical systems
- **Shipping Velocity** - CI/CD, observability, team tooling
- **Lessons from Regulated Domains** - What actually matters in PCI/HIPAA environments (without oversharing secrets)
- **AI Adoption** - Prompt engineering, AI agents, where they actually help

## The Vibe

Think "mind dump" over "polished articles." Real examples. Raw takeaways. Some tangents. Hopefully useful to other engineers building and shipping at scale.
