## A New Space for Thoughts 🤖

Welcome to heyron! This is where I dump thoughts on software engineering, system design, and shipping fast without breaking things.

I spend my days at **Nordstrom** building backend and frontend services in environments where reliability and cost matter. I see patterns in what works and what burns engineers out. I'm also genuinely excited about **AI tools**—not hype, but real productivity wins with Claude and AI agents.

## What You'll Find Here

Real examples from the trenches. Lessons learned. Some tangents. Things that actually matter when you're shipping systems people depend on.

Topics include: system design, observability, cost optimization, shipping velocity, AI tools, and whatever else I'm thinking about. No specific tech stack—I care more about the problem-solving than the language.

## The Vibe

Think "mind dump" over "polished articles." Raw takeaways. You'll hear about what worked, what didn't, and why. Hopefully useful to other engineers building at scale.
